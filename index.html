    <p>Mike Miksch is a neophyte software developer, picking up the thread of his interest after having abandoned it more than two decades ago. Prior to this transition, he was a scientist, part-time photographer,  questionable father, aspiring failed author, and the occasional inventor of new words. He is also the creator of the comic commentary blog, <a href="http://www.superdickery.com">Superdickery</a> dedicated to advancing the thesis that Superman is, in fact, a dick.</p>

    <p>He may, in fact, still be one or more of these things.</p>

    <p>Mike resides in Washington state with his wife, daughter, a garage full of robot toys, and entirely too many cats.  You can ignore him on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MikeMiksch/">@MikeMiksch</a>.</p>
